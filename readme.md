Stream Journey
===============================================================================
`stream-journey` is a continuation of [stream-adventure](https://github.com/workshopper/stream-adventure), letting you watch under the carpet and learn how to use the native Node.js stream API.

Getting Started
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
   - _MacOS_ and _Unix_ users: It is highly recommended to install
     Node.js through [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
2. Run `npm install -g stream-journey`
3. Run `stream-journey`
4. **profit!**

**`stream-journey`** will run you through a series of Node.js workshops to let you explore the power of Node.js streams from simple pipelining to high performance parallelism.
